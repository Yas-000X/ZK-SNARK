## ZK-SNARK
This repository contains mathematical examples and explanations behind Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARK) systems.

It is intended as a learning resource to help understand the core mathematical concepts that power ZK systems, including:

- Polynomial commitments  
- Arithmetic circuits  
- R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint Systems)  
- Trusted setup  
- Proof generation and verification
